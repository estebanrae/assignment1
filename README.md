# Note abour files:
# Since the information about games and participants is stored in files, it is important that the game is ran from the proper directory.
# All files are stored in the assignment1/src/files directory. The relative paths are in the way 'src/files/swimmers.txt',therefore the 
# program should be run from inside the assignment1 directory, but outside the src directory.
